<p>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (transl. Labyrinth 2) is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language comedy horror film directed by Anees Bazmee, written by Aakash Kaushik and Farhad Samji, and produced by T-Series Films and Cine1 Studios. It is a standalone sequel to the 2007 film Bhool Bhulaiyaa. The film stars Kartik Aaryan alongside Kiara Advani and Tabu, and follows travel enthusiast Ruhaan Randhawa, who, after bumping into Reet Thakur, the descendant of a royal family in Bhawanigarh, has to pose as a fraud psychic, Rooh Baba, to deal with the return of Manjulika, a malevolent spirit hell-bent on vengeance against the Thakur family.<br><br>

Principal photography began in October 2019. The production faced prolonged delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before resuming in 2021 and ending in February 2022. It was filmed in Lucknow, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Manali. The film's score was composed by Sandeep Shirodkar, while the songs were composed by Pritam with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Yo Yo Honey Singh, Mandy Gill, and Saaveri Verma, while two songs originally written by lyricist Sameer for the 2007 original were credited to him, including a remix of the title track, recreated by Tanishk Bagchi, who is credited as co-composer.<br><br>

Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 released theatrically worldwide on 20 May 2022 and received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Tabu and Aaryan's performances, humour, musical score, soundtrack, cinematography, and direction, but received criticism for the writing and editing. The film earned ₹266.88 crore (US$32 million) worldwide and became the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film and ninth highest-grossing Indian film of 2022. The film received 10 nominations at the 68th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Bazmee), Best Actress (Tabu), and Best Actor (Aaryan), and won Best Actress (Critics) (Tabu). A spiritual sequel, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, starring Aaryan with Vidya Balan, Madhuri Dixit, and Triptii Dimri, was released on Diwali 2024.</p><br>
